This German lager beer is rich and malty and brewed to an alcohol strength of 6-7%. “Ice Bock” is produced when a Bock beer is partially frozen in order to increase it’s alcohol content. In this process, some of the water content turns to ice, effectively strengthening the flavor and alcohol of the beer. We take this process one step further. After the initial freezing, the beer is decanted off the ice and frozen a second time.

Altbier,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse Little Red Cap,"Notes:Altbier is German for “Old Beer”, this refers to the “old” style of brewing using an ale yeast (As opposed to a lager yeast fermentation which is a relatively new process). This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF. It also won a Silver Award at the 2016 World beer cup.",5.2,25,50,27,39,18,47,52,28,4,24,59,6,100,3.833333,3.833333,3.833333,3.666667,4.0,Loveland,CO,US,"Brewery, Bar, Beer-to-go"

IPA - Imperial,Lagunitas Brewing Company,Lagunitas Brewing Company Hop Stoopid,"Notes:Clean this mess up or else we'll all end up in jail...those test tubes and the scale...just get 'em all outta here..."" He was referring to the complex super-critical-CO2 hop extraction equipment set up on the table in the lab across from the brewhouse. Hop extracts are for the BIG brewers, he thought - suitable only for crummy sub-standard and barely-passable industrial lagers, not the subtle and elegant craft beer made here. But wrong he was. The New Brewer does not eschew any possible inputs.

The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 75 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find.

At over ten percent alcohol, Chicken Killer is actually as substantial as wine, but this is not to say that it is difficult to drink. On the contrary; be careful with this one. The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city.

The name Soft Parade stemmed from two moments in Joe Short’s life. First, because Joe worked as a brewer at the Traverse Brewing Company and The Doors album, The Soft Parade, played every day at the end of the brew shift. The second moment occurred when Joe was driving by himself, flipping through CD’s in his car, and came across The Soft Parade album again. At the time, The Soft Parade beer had not been named and it dawned on Joe that the medley of fruit infusing into the golden beer reminded him of a soft parade.

Brett Beer,Russian River Brewing Company,Russian River Brewing Company Sanctification,"Notes:Who’s afraid of the ""big bad BRETT?"" We’ll tell you who: winemakers! Because of our close proximity to several hundred wineries, we often get winemakers visiting our brewery. (After all, it takes a lot of great beer to make great wine!) Because we use 100% Brettanomyces yeast to ferment Sanctification, most winemakers will only smell the glass, and only a very few will venture to taste the beer. They think the Brettanomyces will attach to their clothing and end up in their winery. A simple solution was offered: keep a smudge pot burning at the door of our brewery so they can burn their clothes when exiting, but even that was not enough. After giving it more thought, we concluded that winemakers think Brettanomyces might scar their taste buds and possible even permeate their skin? Either way, Sanctification is one of the most unique beers you will ever taste! It was fermented with 100% Brettanomyces, rather than the traditional Saccharomyces.\t",4.8,0,0,29,33,5,10,36,133,6,80,16,9,20,4.242762,4.165924,4.242762,4.319599,4.332962,Santa Rosa,CA,US,"Brewery, Bar, Eatery, Beer-to-go"

Being accepted as a true local, Old Style began sponsoring the Chicago Cubs in 1950.

Blonde Ale - Belgian,The Lost Abbey,The Lost Abbey Devotion Ale,"Notes:Belgian Style dry hopped Blonde Ale. It’s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It’s always been a simple life — the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren't sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion.\t",6.0,15,30,31,33,10,74,45,49,4,72,112,38,63,3.822134,3.970356,3.816206,3.875494,3.964427,San Marcos,CA,US,"Brewery, Bar, Beer-to-go"

Therefore, the Heart of Gold beer aging in the barrel starts to absorb back some of the Devil’s Cut and hence the name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"".

Just as most of our beers it's on the ""full body"" scale pushing the envelope of what an American Brown Ale is to most people. The beer is a very deep/dark color of brown with a nice creamy tan head. The mouthfeel of the beer is very soft and is very drinkable.

Although this beer is as cool as ""The Fonz"" when first purchased, it gets really mellow and smooth with some age.

Bock - Traditional,Creemore Springs Brewery Limited,Creemore Springs Brewery Limited Creemore Springs UrBock,"Notes:Bock beers gained notoriety in Munich back in 1612. All the Bavarian nobles were drinking fashionable northern ales known as Einbeck Bier. So Duke Maximillian I of Munich hired his own northern brewmaster, who created a lager similar in character but superior in taste. It won back the local aristocrats. Inspired by his entrepreneurial spirit we started brewing our own urBock – rich, ruby-hued beer with subtle, dark roasted flavours. It’s an aristocratic beer but rest assured, you needn’t be a Duke to enjoy it.28 IBU\t",6.0,20,30,9,54,11,34,85,18,0,29,45,9,115,3.442308,3.647436,3.576923,3.602564,3.660256,Creemore,ON,CA,"Brewery, Beer-to-go"

Lager - American Amber / Red,Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Lager,"Notes:In the late 1800’s Brooklyn was one of the largest brewing centers in the country, home to more than 45 breweries. Lager beer in the “Vienna” style was one of the local favorites. Brooklyn Lager is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original.\t",5.2,18,30,20,27,4,65,34,19,0,23,86,3,72,3.726158,3.891916,3.751589,3.864668,4.024977,Brooklyn,NY,US,"Brewery, Bar"

Pilsner - German,Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Pilsner,"Notes:Brooklyn Pilsner is a refreshing golden lager beer, brewed in the style favored by New York’s pre-prohibition brewers. In the 1840’s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world’s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. German-grown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.\t",5.1,25,40,35,29,7,54,13,8,8,9,72,2,49,3.582108,3.724265,3.693627,3.723039,3.898284,Brooklyn,NY,US,"Brewery, Bar"
Pumpkin Beer,Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Brewery Post Road Pumpkin Ale,"Notes:Early American colonialists, seeking natural ingredients for brewing ales, turned to pumpkins, which were plentiful, flavorful and nutritious. Blended with barley malt, pumpkins became a commonly used beer ingredient. Post Road Pumpkin Ale brings back this tasty tradition. Hundreds of pounds of pumpkins are blended into the mash of each batch, creating a beer with an orange amber color, warm pumpkin aroma, biscuity malt center, and crisp finish.\t",5.0,5,70,16,23,11,13,16,15,1,93,16,66,46,3.720648,3.717274,3.424426,3.500675,3.5722,Brooklyn,NY,US,"Brewery, Bar"

It has a Scottish-style cooler fermentation, which pushes malt to the forefront rather than fruitiness. It was brewed with Scottish Floor-malted Maris Otter, English crystal malts, Belgian Aromatic malt, American roasted malts, American oats and hopped with Willamette.\t",6.1,9,25,15,43,24,33,88,26,0,25,35,14,109,3.585366,3.771951,3.696341,3.670732,3.771951,Brooklyn,NY,US,"Brewery, Bar"

Stout - Russian Imperial,Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout,"Notes:This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. In the 18th century, Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, ordered a stout to be sent to her from England. This beer was brewed strong and hoppy to survive the sea voyage, and it arrived in perfect condition. Soon ""Russian Imperial Stout"" became the toast of the Russian aristocracy. Brewed since 1994, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. It achieves its dark chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six malts and three distinct mashes. Properly kept, it will improve in the bottle for many years. This stout is the toast of the winter season in many countries, and there is nothing better to enjoy with chocolate desserts, cheesecake, ice cream, fine cheeses and roaring fireplaces.Given this beer’s higher ABV and sturdy character, we think it’s a prime candidate for cellaring. Find a cool, dry spot away from light sources, and see how it changes in the years to come. You never quite know what will happen when you age a beer: perhaps the body will smooth out, notes of vanilla, oak, and tannins will come to the front, or hints of leather and soy sauce will make themselves known. No matter what, remember that beer is meant for drinking, so don’t keep it to yourself for too long.\t",10.0,50,90,12,107,34,45,82,7,0,6,30,10,111,4.110544,4.293829,4.165304,4.220883,4.032284,Brooklyn,NY,US,"Brewery, Bar"

Quadrupel (Quad),Brewery Ommegang,Brewery Ommegang Bourbon Barrel Aged Three Philosophers,"Notes:We have a new twist on an old favorite coming out in February. Our unique Three Philosophers Quardupel Ale is universally-known as the preferred elixir of life’s meditators, thinkers and theorizers. Now, thanks to Brewmaster Phil Leinhart and the 24 bourbon barrels he got his hands on, mullers of life’s mysteries can ponder all the more deeply. “We’ve experimented with barrel aging in the past and had great success,” said Brewmaster Phil Leinhart. “Three Philosophers is such a lovely, complex beer and it ages so beautifully that we thought it the perfect fit for pairing with bourbon barrels. The result is exactly what we hoped for: even more complex flavors and a slightly fuller body than the standard. We’re sure this’ll be a crowd pleaser.”Like the original, Bourbon Barrel-aged Three Philosophers pours a deep burgundy hue with a fluffy, off-white head. Patience through the aging process rewarded the brewers with flavors of caramel, raisin, dried fruit, molasses, and vanilla and aromas of oak, vanilla, and subtle hints of cherry. The body is ample but still finishes faintly dry with lingering hints of malt, bourbon, and cherry. The effects of barrel-aging, eliciting remnant alcohol from the cooperage during the aging process, escalated the ABV of the beer from 9.7% to a significant, yet sneakily subtle, 11.4% ABV.ABV varies by batch\t",12.3,25,50,17,53,80,16,106,41,0,104,11,35,123,3.333333,4.0,3.333333,3.166667,3.333333,Cooperstown,NY,US,"Brewery, Bar, Eatery, Beer-to-go"

Dubbel,Brouwerij Westmalle,Brouwerij Westmalle Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,"Notes:Westmalle Dubbel (7%) is a dark red-brown beer with a rich, complex taste thanks to re-fermentation in the bottle.

A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles.

Victoria Ale's aroma is fruity spice, and the taste presents subtle notes of green banana, black pepper, and fresh-crushed mint. With a focus on the subtle, wine-like character of the grapes, the 9.0% ABV brew boasts a pale copper color, Belgian yeast influence, and a medium body with a long candied fruit finish with hints of honeydew melon, and, of course, white wine grapes.\t",9.0,20,40,16,30,16,14,83,43,1,72,21,19,19,3.90678,3.970339,3.974576,3.957627,3.940678,Portland,ME,US,"Brewery, Bar, Beer-to-go"

Farmhouse Ale - Bière de Garde,Leelanau Brewing Company,Leelanau Brewing Company Good Harbor Golden Ale,"Notes:This Golden Ale is Inspired by Franco-Belgain bière de gardes, but not exactly fitting the profile of its European counterparts, this beer is best described as a Michigan Bière de Garde. Hand-crafted by Ron Jeffries at his Jolly Pumpkin Brewery in Dexter, which is consistantly rated as one of one of the best in the world, all of the Leelanau Brewing Company beers are distingushed by their time spent in a large French oak barrique prior to bottling and re-fermentation. The wild yeasts inhabiting the brewery give all the beers made there a common thread, creating a family of beverages with rare harmony, despite their diverse styles.Decidedly refreshing despite the 7.5% abv, this style of beer was originally brewed in the slow winter season as payment for farmhands in the summer. We certainly don’t mind sitting down after a long day of work and breathing deep the symphony aromas wafting from the lofty, lacey head burgeoning from our tulip glass. Subtle notes of peaches, apricots, canned pineapple, bitters, and a faint herbaceousness belie the smooth and delicate taste.

During the next summer, this very thirst-quenching beer was served to the “saisoniers” which were working on the fields. Surely therefore, our Saison Dupont is considered as “the classic” among the Belgian season beers!Coppery blond, the finest aromas and a strong bitterness transform this beer into a thirst-quenchener with no equal, just the way it was created. Our selection of yeasts is the perfect base for these typical aromas and ditto taste.

Farmhouse Ale - Saison,Stillwater Artisanal Ales,Stillwater Artisanal Ales Cellar Door,"Notes:Over the ages the term ’cellar door’ has numerously been referred to as the most beautiful term in the English language. Upon setting out to create the first summer addition to the Stateside line up of ales; the feeling that almost instantly came to me was that of beauty & cleansing. Many summer offerings tend to lack the complexity of their bigger, colder season counterparts; so my goal was to craft an ale of extreme balance with a delicate complexity that allows for contemplation while also providing quaffable refreshment. Starting with a base of German wheat & pale malts this crisp slightly hazy foundation was then accented with a blend of Sterling & Citra hops providing a intricate blend of herbal grass & tangerine citrus flavors and aroma. To pull this all together and to complete the ’cleansing’ aspect of my vision I gently finished the ale off with a touch of white sage, lending a mild earthy spice character to the blend. Of course let’s not forget our house saison yeast that brought all the elements together leaving a dry yet intricate finish.\t",6.6,20,38,38,37,4,31,47,76,0,80,115,20,42,4.141975,4.098765,3.981481,4.148148,4.104938,Baltimore,MD,US,Brewery

So we made it a year-round beer, and it’s now our bestselling beer and our flagship.Since its introduction, Harpoon IPA has remained unique in its ability to balance hop bitterness with a strong malt backbone. Dry-hopped with Cascade hops, it has a floral hop aroma and a finish that is bitter (it is an IPA after all!) without being harsh or astringent. Combined with a malty sweetness and the fruity esters of our proprietary yeast, those hops create a beer that is wonderfully hoppy but clean and refreshing enough to enjoy a few of - and we hope you do.42 IBU\t",5.9,35,60,17,31,13,74,35,31,0,39,110,8,61,3.564855,3.691937,3.589395,3.605171,3.829097,Windsor,VT,US,"Brewery, Bar, Eatery, Beer-to-go"

Lager - Märzen / Oktoberfest,Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Brewery Catamount Octoberfest Beer,"Notes:The character and complexity of Harpoon Octoberfest comes from the malt and hops. When looking at a freshly poured Harpoon Octoberfest, you will notice the garnet-red color with a firm, creamy head. The beer’s color is from a blend of Munich, chocolate, and pale malt. The thick head results in part from wheat malt added to the grist. The hop aroma of this beer is not overpowering but it is present. Tettnang hops add a subtle spice nose that blends with the malt character. This beer is full-bodied, smooth, and malty. Willamettehops are used to provide a gentle bitterness and to balance any residual sweetness present from the malt. The finish is soft and malty with a mild bitterness.30 IBU\t",5.3,18,25,17,60,4,60,59,20,0,24,76,19,115,3.75,4.25,3.75,3.75,4.25,Windsor,VT,US,"Brewery, Bar, Eatery, Beer-to-go"

Wheat Beer - American Pale,Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Brewery UFO Hefeweizen,"Notes:UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer. Perhaps UFO’s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head. The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO. Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character. This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon. The lemon accentuates the yeast’s fruity, tart fragrance. UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body. The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor. UFO has a clean finish. Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.19 IBU\t",4.8,10,35,9,36,4,16,25,54,0,71,25,27,80,3.27371,3.578203,3.416805,3.352745,3.648087,Windsor,VT,US,"Brewery, Bar, Eatery, Beer-to-go"

Winter Warmer,Harpoon Brewery,Harpoon Brewery Harpoon Winter Warmer,"Notes:When you bring a glass of this dark copper ale to your lips to take your first sip you will notice the aroma of cinnamon. There is no aromatic hop added that might overpower the distinct spice scent. The medium body of this beer is formed from caramel and pale malts. These create enough body to support the spices without making the beer excessively rich. Bittering hops are added to counter the sweetness of the malt and spice. The finish of the beer is a blend of cinnamon and nutmeg. The combination of these two spices results in a balanced, pumpkin-pie flavor.22 IBU\t",5.9,35,50,6,34,26,27,49,20,1,26,27,130,70,3.388254,3.492659,3.084013,3.013866,3.020392,Windsor,VT,US,"Brewery, Bar, Eatery, Beer-to-go"

Lager - Japanese Rice,Asahi Breweries Ltd,Asahi Breweries Ltd Asahi Super Dry,"Notes:Asahi Super Dry was a direct result of extensive market research which indicated a consumer preference for a more palatable beer with less maltiness, relatively high alcohol content and a light aftertaste, that paired well with the changing Japanese diet. With this insight Asahi used its brewing knowledge to develop a beer with a crisp bite, refreshing taste and clear finish to satisfied this requirement. Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer. Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability. Barely with high starch content and both noble style bitter and fine aroma hops are key contributors to Super Dry’s smooth taste.

IPA - New England,The Alchemist,The Alchemist Heady Topper,"Notes:Heddy Topper is an American Double India Pale Ale. This beer is not intended to be the biggest or most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate. Tremendous amounts of American hops will creep up on you, and leave you with a dense hoppy finish in you mouth. So drinkable, it's scary. Sometimes I wish I could crawl right into the can.Freshness and control have always been my main concern when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the can? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have work so hard to retain.If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom -- leave them in the can while pouring. This beer is perishable, and at its best when it is young, fresh and hazy. Keep it cold, but not ice cold. Drink this beer immediately, we are always making more. -- John Kimmich75 IBU\t",8.0,50,70,16,42,18,91,40,55,0,76,117,2,30,4.660981,4.163113,4.405117,4.608742,4.6258,Waterbury,VT,US,"Brewery, Beer-to-go"

The resulting Schlenkerla Oak Smokemalt has a smoother and more multilayered smoky note than the intensely aromatic beech smokemalt. The hence complex smokiness in this double bock is paired with the multifaceted bitterness of finest Hallertau aroma hops. With 8% alcohol and amber color it matures for months in the 14th century brewery cellars into a special treat for smoke beer lovers.

Lager - Rauchbier,Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla Aecht Schlenkerla Krausen,"Notes:Also known as Helles Märzen Kräusen Blend.In the world of German brewing, Kräusen refers to the intense proliferation of bubbles and foam formed during fermentation of a young or “green” beer. And Aufkräusen (literally to kräusen it up), refers to a historic brewing technique in which some green beer is added to a fully-matured lager. This is a very old and very typically German tradition, and today even English-speaking brewers refer to this technique as krausening. Krausening brings the vibrant freshness of young beer to the more refined, austere flavors of a fully-matured lager.Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen starts out as normal Helles Schlenkerla Lager and matures for months in the old rock cellars underneath the brewery. Just before filling it is blended using the before mentioned ""Kräusen"" technique with classic Märzen Rauchbier. The result is an unfiltered, bottom fermented and amber color Märzen Lager hybrid with a vibrant and slightly smoky flavor.IBU: 30\t",4.55,20,30,29,56,12,22,23,13,1,6,28,93,67,3.807692,4.038462,4.038462,3.884615,3.923077,Bamberg,,DE,"Brewery, Bar, Eatery, Beer-to-go"

The name ""Kellerbier"" has historical roots, dating back to the time when beer was still served directly from the cellar. It is an unfiltered, naturally cloudy beer with a low carbon dioxide content, and it contains all of the natural sediment. As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent. It’s a beer which is almost unrivaled in taste, thanks to its extremely delicately spiced, original flavor.\t",5.2,20,40,13,52,18,36,71,21,0,32,52,9,117,3.368421,3.736842,3.763158,3.526316,3.684211,Ravensburg,,DE,Brewery

This guarantees flour of a very high quality, from a totally natural environment.Highly fermentable, chestnut flour has an excellent impact on the quality of the head and gives beer its beautiful coloring. Mixed into the malt during the mashing process, the chestnut flour is a prime ingredient and not just a flavoring.This recipe, unique in the world, gives PIETRA its conflicting taste accentuating a lingering subtle bitterness.Powerful and delicate, robust and smooth, Pietra has a 6% alcohol content. It displays a beautiful amber color, an intense chestnut head, dense and creamy, making the pleasure of tasting it all the more enjoyable.\t",6.0,15,30,25,28,18,26,51,19,0,9,57,5,126,3.416667,3.5,3.458333,3.583333,3.541667,Furiani,,FR,Brewery

Lambic - Fruit,Brasserie Cantillon,Brasserie Cantillon Cantillon Rosé De Gambrinus,"Notes:""It has the colour of onion skin"", said a voice behind me. It was Raymond Coumans. He was admiring the colour of the raspberry lambic reflecting in the red copper of the buckets used to empty the barrels. At that time (1986), ""Raspberry-Lambic"" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a rosé, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.The process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Rosé de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.\t",5.0,15,21,29,37,3,6,118,117,0,104,17,3,14,4.155694,4.109431,4.090747,4.170819,4.009786,Brussels,,BE,"Brewery, Bar, Beer-to-go"

Lambic - Traditional,Brasserie Cantillon,Brasserie Cantillon Cantillon Iris,"Notes:It is a completely original beer which, contrary to the other products of the Brewery, is not brewed with 35% of wheat. The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called ""cold hopping"", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.\t",6.5,0,10,69,34,16,90,59,191,4,123,100,17,56,4.197832,4.039295,4.123306,4.226287,4.093496,Brussels,,BE,"Brewery, Bar, Beer-to-go"

Lambic - Fruit,Brouwerij Lindemans,Brouwerij Lindemans Lindemans Kriek,"Notes:Also known as Kriek FoudroyanteWe've already told you that our family never does anything the way other people do. Kriek Lindemans is a good example of that. In order to obtain a beer like no other, we have been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuvée René, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.18 IBU\t",3.5,15,21,22,28,10,3,87,89,0,102,7,9,13,3.920382,4.031847,3.847134,3.915074,3.83758,Vlezenbeek,,BE,Brewery

Lambic - Gueuze,Brouwerij Lindemans,Brouwerij Lindemans Lindemans Gueuze,"Notes:From the brewery:There are several stories to explain the origin of the term 'gueuze'. This name dates back to the Rue de Gueuze in Brussels where, for the first time, a producer offered his delicious lambic in champagne bottles. Word about the 'lambick on Rue de Gueuze' quickly got around. According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze. Developed according to this production method, Gueuze Lindemans is a slightly sweeter version of Old Gueuze Cuvée René.\t",5.0,0,10,31,32,7,8,131,183,0,97,24,3,24,3.640805,3.747126,3.635057,3.617816,3.649425,Vlezenbeek,,BE,Brewery

Unknown to many, some of the Trappist brewers also brew a milder ale for daily consumption within the walls of the monastery.

Milk sugar (lactose) contributes to the full body of this stout and tames its roasty character, while oats lend a silky quality. Enjoy fresh, or cellar for a special occasion.

Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom West Coast Wheat Wine,"Notes:Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast.Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is a heavyweight  this year (2005) tipping the scales at approximately 9.5% alcohol by volume. 50 percent of the fermentable extract is derived from malted wheat, and this lends a quenching drinkability rare to beers of this strength. This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel. The hops once again are 100% American West Coast types; this year, though, large additions of Vanguard and Sterling render the hop character softer and spicier than last years boldly citrus performance.\t",10.5,45,85,18,45,33,37,96,63,0,81,32,7,70,3.791667,3.75,3.791667,3.666667,3.791667,Shizuoka-ken Numazu-shi,,JP,"Brewery, Eatery, Beer-to-go"

Red Ale - American Amber / Red,Switchback Brewing Company,Switchback Brewing Company Switchback Ale,"Notes:Switchback Ale (First sold October 22nd, 2002) Using only traditional ingredients, Switchback Ale is a reddish-amber ale which is particularly well-balanced, allowing for complexity of flavor coupled with an unusually smooth and refreshing character. Five different malts, select hop varieties, and our own specially cultivated yeast create an ale which leads with hop flavors and a subtle impression of fruit (our yeast's contribution), followed by a palate pleasing malty finish. Our own special process uses the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer, and we leave it unfiltered. The result is a satisfying brew full of flavor with a remarkably clean and smooth finish.\t",5.0,25,45,7,34,4,36,33,30,0,32,46,0,56,3.302817,3.514085,3.528169,3.556338,3.683099,Burlington,VT,US,"Brewery, Bar, Beer-to-go"

Elegant and rustic, and full of complex flavors, berries, spice, and a hint of nuttiness, this is a great beer to share with friends on a special occasion.Born of the fortuitous encounter between a strong stout and fermented apricots from the Valais, which never reached the distillers. Our Oud Bruin (Flemish for “Old Brown”) is a rather unorthodox take on the style. It nevertheless boasts the typical sweet and sour balance between a solid malty, toffee-like, chocolaty, roasted and fruity backbone. Into this the fermented apricots merge seamlessly, with their lactic sourness, leathery and horse blanket notes from wild yeasts and a discrete touch of apricot deep down. It finally evolves harmoniously into a slightly bitter finish.

Sour - Flanders Red Ale,Brouwerij Verhaeghe,Brouwerij Verhaeghe Vichtenaar,"Notes:The ""Vichtenaar"" is a beer that is brewed on the basis of deeply burned malt, spicy and fruity hops, yeast and soft water pumped from a well with a depth of 172 m, which is a guarantee of the quality and the purity of the water. After the main fermentation and the second lagering the ""Vichtenaar"" undergoes a third fermentation in oak casks for several months. The oak casks are large vats with a capacity ranging between 5000 and 25000 liters. The ""Vichtenaar"" is a traditional and typical beer for West Flanders, in the Northwest of Belgium. The taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" can be described as slightly acidic and complex and this through the long fermentation in oak casks. The fresh taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" makes it a particularly thirst-quenching beer, especially during the summer months. The ""Vichtenaar"" is also one of the last old-Flemish red-brown beers which are matured in oak casks and is especially appreciated for its authenticity by the beer connoisseur. In 1958 “Brewery Verhaeghe” obtained for its beer ""Vichtenaar"" the first prize in the international contest for beers in Ghent.\t",5.1,10,25,32,36,16,6,124,154,0,113,9,17,23,3.95202,3.997475,3.95202,4.0,4.0,Vichte,,BE,Brewery
Sour - Flanders Red Ale,Brouwerij Verhaeghe,Brouwerij Verhaeghe Verhaeghe Echte Kriek / Echte Kriekenbier,"Notes:Echt Kriekenbier, (real cherry beer)"" is as the name suggests a cherry beer that is manufactured with only the real fruit of cherries instead of with flavor enhancers or extracts of cherries. The fruit is sourced from the region around Sint-Truiden in Limburg (Belgium).Unlike the most famous fruit beers the basic beer of the ""real cherry beer"" is not a Lambic but a West-Flemish red-brown ale aged in oak wood. About mid-July at the picking, the Northern cherries are brought in at the brewery and laid in on the base beer.Because the taste of the cherry fruit varies from year to year and this according to the number of hours of sunshine or rain, the kriekenbier at its final composition is blended with cherry beer from the year before and two-year old cherry beer. This with the intention of becoming a more constant taste of the ""real cherry beer"" over the years.\t",6.8,10,25,37,26,7,2,91,140,0,131,13,13,28,3.850543,3.904891,3.714674,3.828804,3.790761,Vichte,,BE,Brewery

It starts with an acidic base that has made at least 2 years of mixed fermentations (conducted mainly by lactic, acetic bacteria and brettanomyces) which have at least 6 months macerated cherries and sour cherries, blend with a small part of chimera and some young beer; the blend is put in numbered bottles indicating the year of the cuvée, which refined further 12 months before selling.La Luna Rossa is like a kriek on the basis flemish red, has an extraordinary complexity associated with a wonderful elegance, for lovers of the genre is definitely one of those beers that you find it difficult to forget.- GiovanniIn the glass, to the nose and in the mouth …Born from the blend about different beers, some of them aged in barrels until 2 years with the addition morello and marasca cherries.
